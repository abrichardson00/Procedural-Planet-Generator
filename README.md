# Procedural_Planet_Generator
Playing about in Unity, generating planet terrain and making the sky look cool with a raymarching shader.

This isn't a downloadable whole Unity project and even if it was, the project is 2 years old and kind of broken. Last thing I was trying to do was simulate the orbits of multiple planet as well - which was a stupid idea considering how messy the code was becoming.
